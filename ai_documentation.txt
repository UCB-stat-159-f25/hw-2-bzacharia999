History of prompts and messages:

1)
prompt:
"conda env export | grep numpy, instead of just numpy", how can i grep all the dependencies and their versions at the command line with something similar?

output: 
conda env export --no-builds | grep -v '^(name|channels|prefix):'
This command uses the --no-builds flag to remove the OS-specific build hash (e.g., _h12345) while retaining the package name and version number (package=version). It then uses grep -v (invert match) to exclude the lines that are not part of the package list.

2)
prompt: how can I check the python version my ipykernel is using in my jupyter notebook

output:
import sys
print(sys.version)
