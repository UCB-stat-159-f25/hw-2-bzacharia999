History of prompts and messages:

1)
prompt:
"conda env export | grep numpy, instead of just numpy", how can i grep all the dependencies and their versions at the command line with something similar?

output: 
conda env export --no-builds | grep -v '^(name|channels|prefix):'
This command uses the --no-builds flag to remove the OS-specific build hash (e.g., _h12345) while retaining the package name and version number (package=version). It then uses grep -v (invert match) to exclude the lines that are not part of the package list.

2)
prompt: how can I check the python version my ipykernel is using in my jupyter notebook

output:
import sys
print(sys.version)

3)
prompt: i used git tag to create a tag after i got some work done, but when I pushed it, I couldnt see the tag in my remote repository. Maybe Im looking at the wrong place but where can I usually find my tags?

output:
You can't see your tag in the remote repository because git push does not automatically push tags. Tags are treated as separate objects from your commits and must be pushed explicitly.

Your issue is almost certainly due to missing the dedicated push command for tags.

To Push All Local Tags:
This command pushes every tag you have locally that doesn't already exist on the remote:
git push origin --tags
